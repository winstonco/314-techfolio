<p>This widget was my first project and my introduction to web development. It is just a box made with raw HTML and CSS, with a scrolling background image that responds to various Twitch events. The scrolling background is like Atrioc‚Äôs webcam background, and the integrated alerts that pop out are like Northernlion‚Äôs.</p>

<h3 id="the-goal-">The goal üèÅ</h3>

<p>The goal of this project was very simple: I just wanted a box that did something when a Twitch event happened. <em>I mean, how hard can that be?</em></p>

<h3 id="first-learning-web-development">First learning web development</h3>

<p>Turns out, pretty hard.</p>

<p>Originally, I planned to use Stream Elements‚Äô developer toolkit to make the widget, but after messing around with it for a day, I decided against it because it would be 1) easier to make it from scratch, and 2) more beneficial to learn from the ground up. Well, after day one, I felt like I was throwing myself in the fire, even though I knew the project was simple in concept. To put things in perspective, before making this, I had only worked with HTML and CSS (and <em>very</em> little JS). I was practically following tutorials for every step of the way. I didn‚Äôt really know what the difference between a server and client is, I‚Äôd never even heard of ‚ÄúREST‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt know what a webhook or CLI was, basically I was a complete beginner.</p>

<h3 id="week-1">Week 1:</h3>

<p>By this point, I made the simple box with scrolling background, and a function to make a little pop up appear with text. I set up an Express server to serve the static files, and set up Socket.io to send real-time messages from client to server. I read a little more of the Twitch docs and played around with their CLI, trying to get something to show up in the console.</p>

<p>During this week, and actually most of them, I spent most of my time reading through the docs and tutorials for the Twitch API. Specifically, I adapted the code from this <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/handling-webhook-events/#simple-nodejs-example">Simple Node.js example</a>.</p>

<h3 id="week-2">Week 2:</h3>

<p>In week 2, I had a better understanding of how OAuth protocol worked, but I still had trouble getting my event handler to receive mock events from the CLI. Eventually, I was able to get some of those events listeners working for real events (but still not from the CLI). After doing a lot more reading, I found myself looking at using Nginx for a reverse-proxy to localhost, but instead chose to just have it hosted somewhere. I picked the hosting service, <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a>, semi-arbitrarily, but mainly because I read they have a good free tier.</p>

<p>I thought I was done, or at least very close, but the deployment kept failing and having issues. Plus, since I still could not use the CLI to test my app, it was difficult to continue development. I was pretty sure my problems stemmed only from a lack of understanding, so I told myself I would come back to this project once I learned more.</p>

<h3 id="finishing-touches">Finishing touches:</h3>

<p>Fast forward to January 13, a few months later, and I came back to the project to get things in order. When I looked back at my code, I didn‚Äôt realize how messy and hard to follow it was. I split up the express server code from the Twitch constants and functions. I also added a janky UI so I could control its functionality by interacting with it directly from OBS.</p>
