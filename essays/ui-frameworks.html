  <h3 id="heres-the-tldr">Here‚Äôs the tl;dr</h3>

<p>I like using UI frameworks because they make creating specific components easier, but you don‚Äôt have the same customizability as using plain CSS, and sometimes a CSS solution is easier to implement.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-ui-framework">What is a UI framework?</h3>

<p>A UI framework is a framework (<em>duh</em>) for making user interfaces (<em>duh</em> x2). For web development, think of them as a layer on top of plain HTML, JS, and CSS. They package them together in reusable components that make it easier to build web applications. They can be as constrict as whole button components, or as free as a div that comes with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">display: flex;</code>. They can help in designing layouts, making responsive websites, etc.</p>

<h3 id="so-why-use-a-ui-framework">So, why use a UI framework?</h3>

<p>I understand the appeal of using a UI framework like Bootstrap. Many websites have similar layouts with common components, like a navbar, footer, maybe a hero image, etc. Bootstrap is an easy way to implement all these things. All the bootstrap components are ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù, so they don‚Äôt go into too much detail on how each component works. From this, you get easy-to-use, standardized components that can be placed into any project. The drawback being that a bootstrap website looks like, well, a bootstrap website.</p>

<p>The other advantage that Bootstrap provides is all its utility classes. Making a div a flexbox, for example, is very simple to do with Bootstrap (just add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d-flex</code> to the div‚Äôs class list). However, if you want to start doing things custom, you‚Äôll find yourself writing something like:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"d-flex flex-column align-items-center justify-content-center gap-2"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  üòµ
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>before you realize you just wrote as much as I would doing it in normal css.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs the same realization I had while learning and working with Bootstrap. I appreciate things like a navbar class for navs or a container on a div to make its max-width responsive, but many of the utility classes are mostly a waste of time. When you just need a quick fix on a single element, like making the text bold, is it really easier to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class="fw-bold"</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">style="font-weight: bold;"</code> or wrapping it in <b></b> tags?</p>

<h3 id="other-ui-frameworks">Other UI frameworks:</h3>

<h4 id="tailwind">Tailwind</h4>

<p>I tried another popular CSS framework that makes everything a utility class, called Tailwind. A lot of people like it because it removes one of the hardest things in coding: naming things. Say goodbye to class names like middle-section-container‚Ä¶ say hello to extremely ugly HTML because classnames end up being entire lines long.</p>

<p>An example from the Tailwind homepage:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;div</span>
  <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"grid gap-4 col-start-1 col-end-3 row-start-1 sm:mb-6 sm:grid-cols-4 lg:gap-6 lg:col-start-2 lg:row-end-6 lg:row-span-6 lg:mb-0"</span>
<span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  ...
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you really hate writing CSS, then I could see it making things easier, but to me it‚Äôs not worth the hassle.</p>

<h4 id="material-ui">Material UI</h4>

<p>Another framework called Material UI is similar to bootstrap in that it defines premade components, the difference being it is a React component library, not a CSS? library. Since Material UI uses Google‚Äôs Material Design, everything looks very professional and like it‚Äôs a Google product, so if that‚Äôs the style you are looking for, Material UI does the job very well. It‚Äôs not as open as Bootstrap or Tailwind since it forces you to use the Material Design system, but if you didn‚Äôt want to, you wouldn‚Äôt be using MUI.</p>
