  <h3 id="ics-414-software-engineering-ii-reflection">ICS 414: Software Engineering II Reflection</h3>

<p>Usually, in the class Software Engineering II, the instructor connects the students with a client, who outlines the kind of project they need completed. However, unfortunately, this semester, we were unable to get a client, and spent our time remaking a past app: HACC Hui, an admin app for Hawaii’s Annual Code Challenge.</p>

<p>This meant we didn’t get to think about the kind of app we were making, the tech we wanted to use/try, how to write a codebase from scratch, etc. Basically, I think we didn’t experience the actually helpful part of the class. Instead, every task was just converting one file into a file that looks almost exactly the same, with some updates for modern code. It was very hard to find motivation to work on this, since at no point did it ever feel like it was “our app”. At every milestone (2 week block), it just felt like another homework assignment that was due.</p>

<p>Another problem, which isn’t something I can really change, is the relative skill level of my teammates. I understand it’s a random draw, but for some people it’s shocking to me that they are in a 400 level class. Since the groups were relatively large, combined with not feeling motivated to push a polished product, it was hard to teach members who, frankly, didn’t know what they were doing.</p>

<p>This is more of a problem with the overall ICS curriculum. Throughout my career in ICS, there have been few moments which I felt really tested, at least in the coding department (ICS should not require WI’s). There are a lot of students who are able to just “wing it” and pass, which obviously means the classes are too easy. I don’t have statistics on-hand, but some classes feel like they are more meant to churn out “happy” students rather than motivated ones.</p>

<p>Overall, I hope this class serves students better in future semesters.</p>
